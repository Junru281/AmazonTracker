# AmazonTracker

This is a Tracker Application using Python. 

It contains two tracker. 

One is to track the price drops at Amazon, following [the Youtube video from Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY). 

Recently, I have been fascinated for Polo Ralph Lauren and it happened to the time when they do winter sale for those sweaters, hoodies, and shirts. 

For instance, the Boys(8-20) Cable-Knit Cotton Sweater of size L/XL runs out super fast (Like in 5 minutes). I have waited for over two months to get a XL one. Therefore, inspired by the Ed's project on tracking the price for Amazon, I intend to keep tracking of the restock for Ralph Lauren clothes. 

So here comes my scraper. 

1. ***URL***

- It's going to ask you for the URL for that item with that specific color. For instance, if I want to look at *Cable-Knit Cotton Sweater[Oasis Yellow]*, then the URL is https://www.ralphlauren.com/boys-clothing-sweaters/cable-knit-cotton-sweater/0078655842.html

- If I want to look at *Cable-Knit Cotton Sweater[Carmel Pink]*, then the URL is https://www.ralphlauren.com/boys-clothing-sweaters/cable-knit-cotton-sweater/0078655883.html

2. ***Desired Size***
- What size are you looking for? It could be uppercase or lowercase

3. ***Desired Color***
- What color are you looking for? 

- ***Attention***: You have to capitalize for each word. For example: Oasis Yellow.


4. ***Interval***
- How long would you want to wait before next check? Enter the number in the unit of minutes. If you type in 1, that means 1 minute. 

After the waiting time, I will ask you if you want to stop tracking. If you type Y, then we will stop tracking your item. If you type N, then we will continue tracking.

5. ***Reciver***
- Whom are you sending to? Type in the person's email to whom you want to send to. 


Cool! After this small tutorial, you are ready to use this to keep track if a polo shirt is returning back on stock! Buy it before it is gone!ðŸ«¡

Good Luck ~ ðŸ¤ž
